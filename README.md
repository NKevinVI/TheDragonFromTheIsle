## Introduction

Lacking any good dragon simulator that could run on low hardware, I decided to make one of my own.

## Used Applications

- *Blender* (a very powerful 3D modeller).

- *Godot*.

- *Inkscape* (was used to create the `BaseCol.png` file, being my only palette of colours).

- *Vim*, because I like to use the terminal, sometimes.
